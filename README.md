The biggest [Warez](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warez_scene) list on the entire internet! This list is an overview of Warez related topics, discussions and provides some background information about the scene.

## Disclaimer
**I or GitHub do not supporting warez - we're also not responsible for external links or their content! If you dislike the information I provide then contact the website owner/webmaster/hoster directly and fill a [DMCA](https://www.dmca.com/faq/What-is-a-DMCA-Takedown) request.**

### Why was the list created?
* Research reasons!
* Freedom of information!
* Most lists you find are outdated, not actively maintained or full of malware links.

### Credits
Since this list is huge I can't name each and every single one of you, but here is a short credit list which hopefully covers all of them:

* All [contributors](https://github.com/CHEF-KOCH/Warez/graphs/contributors).
* All demoscene people which helped to build the _scene_.
* All developers which build the mentioned programs on this list.
* All other people which helped to push this little project forward.
* All people which are involved in the piracy & netsec scene or created forums to talk about such topics.

### What **does not** belong on this list?
* Illegal programs (cracks, keygens etc) or direct links to copyright material.
* Links to [banned websites](https://github.com/CHEF-KOCH/Warez/blob/master/Banned.md).
* Links to [offline websites](https://github.com/CHEF-KOCH/Warez/blob/master/Offline.md).
* Software which is outdated or not actively maintained, open source software is preferred.
* Insecure programs (no audit- or code-review).
* Why is program _x_ not listed e.g. K-9 mail it's FOSS! Not every mention makes sense, especially in a [security context](https://github.com/k9mail/k-9/issues/655).

### How can I contribute to this list?
* You can [submit a pull request](https://github.com/CHEF-KOCH/Warez/pulls) - after you [read the contributions guidelines](https://github.com/CHEF-KOCH/Warez/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## How to search on this page?
* A search function is planned, [among other small features](https://github.com/CHEF-KOCH/Warez/blob/master/.github/PROJECT_ToDo.md).
* Since there is (currently) - no filter or search you can navigate trough the page from within your Browser via `Ctrl + F` or `Cmd + F`.
