### MagisK Modules

**Important**: There are lots of false statements/misinformation that modules like XPrivacyLua, Device ID Maske, XPosed & Co. (in general) or other modules making your OS or parts of your apps "secure" or "private". This is wrong, as explained over [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/GrapheneOS/comments/ch5kv8/is_magisk_and_edxposedxprivacylua_working/). Such FUD and scam modules/apps do not offer any privacy nor security layer (keep also in mind that "underground" and dangerous modules are not listed officially on the official servers). Please also keep in mind that if you like a secure and private OS then stay away from all rooting methods, scripts or engines and use the naked (hardened) OS with only the apps with are regularily getting audited e.g. Threema. The modules which are listed here are "helpful" in a sense that they "add" xyz function to the OS and not meant to secure/harden something.
